  - When to Use Cypress:
If you need fast, reliable testing and donâ€™t require cross-browser or mobile device support.
If you want an easy-to-set-up tool with great debugging and a developer-friendly API.
Best for modern web applications running primarily in Chrome-based environments.

- When to Use WebDriver.io:
If you need to test across multiple browsers or devices, including mobile.
If you have complex test scenarios that require interaction with multiple tabs/windows or external services.
Ideal for larger teams or projects where cross-platform and parallel testing is essential.
